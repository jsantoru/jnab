# Jnab
This app is running at: https://jsantoru.github.io/jnab/

An ESPP calculator written in Angular4 with Material. Uses a node backend (still needs to be hosted).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

A simple way to deploy your Angular app is to use GitHub Pages.

The first step is to create a GitHub account, and then create a repository for your project. Make a note of the user name and project name in GitHub.

Then all you need to do is run ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href PROJECT_NAME, where PROJECT_NAME is the name of your project in GitHub. Make a copy of docs/index.html and name it docs/404.html.

Commit your changes and push. On the GitHub project page, configure it to publish from the docs folder.

And that's all you need to do! Now you can see your page at https://USER_NAME.github.io/PROJECT_NAME/.

You can also use angular-cli-ghpages, a full featured package that does this all this for you and has extra functionality.
